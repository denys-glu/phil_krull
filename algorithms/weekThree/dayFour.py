# Is Palindrome
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Strings like "Able was I, ere I saw Elba" or "Madam, I'm Adam" could be considered palindromes, because (if we ignore spaces, punctuation and capitalization) the letters are the same from front and back. Create a function that returns a boolean whether the string is a strict palindrome. For "a x a" or "racecar", return true. Do not ignore spaces, punctuation and capitalization: if given "Dud" or "oho!", return false.


"tacocat"
"tacocat" # => True

"today"
"yadot" # => False

# Longest Palindrome
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For this challenge, we will look not only at the entire string, but also substrings within it. For a string, return the longest palindromic substring. Given "what up, dada?", return "dad". Given "not much", return "n". Include spaces as well (i.e. be strict, as in the “Is Palindrome” challenge): given "My favorite racecar erupted!", return "e racecar e".
